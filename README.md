A website that allows you to buy products online, it serves two classes, admin and client, eCommerce was done partially through emails after the clients take a look over all products on the main page which provides a filter for all categories and brands once they like the product they add it to the cart either in the wish list , if he wants to continue the process and confirm the order so he has to fill up the registered form with all details like address, and here they are allowed to write a comment for the item or give it a rate, If they are not happy with the quality or something so they can send feedback to the company email.
